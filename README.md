# BioRender Note App: Full Stack (Hooks)

This app uses React (with hooks) on the frontend, express as its server, and sqlite as its database. Its a simple app, where users can create and delete notes.

To complete this test, first find and fix all of the bugs on the front and back ends of the application. There are:

- 3 frontend bugs.
- 1 backend bug.

Afterwards, as a stretch goal, please add a way to edit notes.

Feel free to change any part of the app, from the code style to the implementation.

This is an open-book test so feel free to Google things, or ask questions!
