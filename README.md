# BioRender Note App: Backend (Extra)

This app uses React (with hooks) on the frontend, express as its server, and sqlite as its database. Its a simple app, where users can create, delete, and search/sort notes.

Currently the backend of the search/sort functionality is missing. Add it to complete the test.

Feel free to change any part of the app, from the code style to the implementation.

This is an open-book test so feel free to Google things, or ask questions!
