# BioRender Note App: Front End (Hooks)

This app uses React (with hooks) on the frontend, express as its server, and sqlite as its database. Its a simple app, where users can create and delete notes.

To complete this test, first find and fix all of the bugs on the front end of the application. There are a total of 3 bugs.

Next, update the style of the application to match [these](https://scene.zeplin.io/project/601b083a92af6724b5a973bf) designs as closely as possible.

Feel free to change any part of the app, from the code style to the implementation.

This is an open-book test so feel free to Google things, or ask questions!
